      <h3>A little something about Mark</h3>
      <p>Homeschooled most of my life, I began traveling the world at the age of seventeen. From Europe to China and Vietnam, I studied languages and focused on further developing my passion for programming and working with others. I began building text-based adventure games in Python, and text-based incremental adventure games using Javascript.</p>
      <p>In recent years I have worked as a Camera Assistant and Drone Pilot on a wide range of productions and projects. Working on set requires a few things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Constant collaboration with others</li>
        <li>Unnering attention to detail</li>
        <li>Situational awareness</li>
      </ul>
        <p>I am excited to apply this knowledge to the world of programming and see where this path takes me.  When I'm not writing code, I'm usually racing FPV drones or working on finishing my most recent book, and if I'm not doing either of those I'm most likely sleeping.</p>
