      <h3>A little something about Mark</h3>
      <p>Homeschooled most of my life, I began traveling the world at the age of seventeen. From Europe to China and Vietnam, I studied languages and focused on further developing my passion for programming and working with others. I began building text-based adventure games in Python, and text-based incremental adventure games using Javascript.</p>
      <p>Throughout my years studying Mandarin overseas, I developed a passion for developing applications to assist people with learning, especially new languages and skills. There are still leaps and bounds to be made when it comes to developing student learning-enhancement software, and I look forward to one day helping others through the power of computers. Over the years I have learned that successfully working with others requires a few key things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Constant collaboration and precise communication</li>
        <li>Unnering attention to detail</li>
        <li>Situational awareness</li>
        <li>Problem solving and logical thinking</li>
      </ul>
        <p>I deeply enjoy working with others to accomplish goals and striving for success. When I'm not writing programs, I'm usually racing FPV drones or working on finishing my most recent book, and if I'm not doing either of those I'm most likely sleeping.</p>
